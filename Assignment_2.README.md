#Assignment_2

The Structure

The assignment should be completed in RMarkdown and knitted into a html file. Your submission should be a zip file containing the RMarkdown file and the html output it creates. When the RMarkdown file is re-run, it must produce the same html output that you submit.

This should be a professionally formatted technical report that another analyst could use to verify all the steps of your analysis (including code), clearly understand what conclusions you draw, and see why you make those conclusions. It should read in the datafiles provided, check the integrity of data, calculate all of the statistics requested, and knit together to form a html file.

The purpose of this report is that it could be shared with someone else who is not familiar with the data or project, but is expert in R and statistics. They should be able to see how you achieved your results, and if necessary, easily modify the code to work with new or updated data. Therefore, the appropriateness of your comments and data documentation will also be assessed. Where appropriate, you should report both NHST and estimation approaches. You should ensure that the results of statistical tests are reported in a professional manner, following standard reporting conventions. You should also state the results in plain English and say what they mean or what they tell us about the real scenario. Any tables and figures (if appropriate) should be professionally formatted, such that they could be used in public reports or external publications.

The official word count for this assignment is 2500 words, but the written content of the report should be much shorter than this. Since this is a code and analysis based assignment, the word count is not directly applicable in the way that it is for an essay. The word count is provided as a guide: that this assignment is assumed to be approximately the same amount of work as a 2500 word essay. The report should be short, succinct and clear in communicating the main results only of the elements requested in the assignment question. 

The Request

Question 1 - London bike hires and covid restrictions – 50% of the Grade

This section uses data from the London bike hire scheme 
(https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/number-bicycle-hires) and about COVID restrictions
(https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/covid-19-restrictions-timeseries).

We are interested in the effect upon bike hire usage as a result of three elements of the COVID response: Work From Home, Rule of 6 Indoors, and the Eat Out to Help Out scheme. 

Use the data provided to perform regression analyses that examine the effect of these elements upon the number of bike rentals. You should also explore whether it is appropriate to control for the effect of potential differences between different years, months, and days of the week.

Question 2 – Book Sales – 50% of the Grade

This question asks you to examine data from an e-book a publishing company. The data provided contains information on e-book sales over a period of many months. Each row in the data represents one book. The values of the variables are taken across the entire time period, so daily.sales is the average number of sales (minus refunds) across all days in the period, and sale.price is the average price for which the book sold in the period.

You should use this data to answer the following:
Do books have more/fewer sales depending upon their average review scores and total number of reviews. What is the effect of sale price upon the number of sales, and is this different across genres?cluding additional irrelevant information or materials can have a negative impact on your mark.
